# pyscheme
In this project, I developed an interpreter for a subset of the Scheme language.

This project includes several files:
scheme.py	               The Scheme evaluator
scheme_reader.py	       The Scheme syntactic analyzer
scheme_tokens.py	       A tokenizer for scheme
scheme_primitives.py	   Primitive Scheme procedures
scheme_test.py	           A testing framework for Scheme
scheme_grader.py	       A suite of tests for the project
ucb.py	                   Utility functions
autograder.py	           Utility functions for grading
tests.scm	               A collection of test cases written in Scheme
tests2.scm	               A collection of test cases written in Scheme
